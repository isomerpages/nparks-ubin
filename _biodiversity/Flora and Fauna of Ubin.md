<h4><strong>A Treasure Trove of Biodiversity&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Pulau Ubin is a hotspot for nature lovers due to its rich wildlife. The
National Parks Board (NParks) estimates that the island has over&nbsp;786
native plants, 242 birds, 201 butterflies, 89 mammals, reptiles &amp; amphibians.
Many of these species are very rare and some are not found on mainland
Singapore.</p>
<p>Pulau Ubin is also a key sanctuary for wildlife such as the <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/1/1/11" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Mousedeer</a></strong>,
bats like the <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nparksbuzz/posts/the-ashy-roundleaf-bat-hipposideros-cineraceus-was-first-recorded-on-pulau-ubin-/1960144947358305/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ashy Roundleaf Bat</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/2/1/219" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lesser False Vampire</a></strong>,
and birds like the <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/3/6/36" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Straw-headed Bulbul</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/2/7/276" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mangrove Pitta</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/6/3/630" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Barred Eagle Owl</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/nparksbuzz/nov-issue-2020/conservation/in-the-lonely-'owl'" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Brown Wood Owl</a></strong>.
Pulau Ubin hosts the largest mangrove areas in Singapore and almost all
mangrove plant species known to Singapore can be found here, including
one of the rarest mangrove species in the world, the “<strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/4/0/4002" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Eye of the Crocodile</a></strong>”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of Pulau Ubin’s key attractions is Chek Jawa Wetlands, located on
the eastern coast of the island. It has one of Singapore’s richest ecosystems,
where 6 major habitats meet and mix. Each habitat is home to an abundance
of flora and fauna, such as rare plants as well as local and migratory
birds. The marine biodiversity here is amazing, with about 500 species,
according to NParks’ records.</p>
<p>NParks runs a visitor centre at Chek Jawa with a viewing jetty, over 1
km of boardwalk and a 21-metre tall viewing tower. Chek Jawa is also home
to Singapore’s only 2 mangrove Heritage Trees, which are listed in the
Heritage Tree Register of Singapore. Known as <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/4/7/4739" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Perepat</a></strong> or
Mangrove Apple, they are possibly two of the biggest in Singapore.</p>
<p>NParks and its volunteers carry out on-going field research and monitoring
studies, including plant surveys, seagrass monitoring, bird ringing and
camera trapping. Habitat enhancement efforts like reforestation, restoration
of mangroves and rehabilitation of freshwater ponds, as well as species
recovery projects like the <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/-/media/cuge/ebook/citygreen/cg4/cg4_14.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=0463E2630FB091E0BE1AA5B6AEA70AD27CC43FF0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Hornbill Project</a></strong> and
Butterfly Hill, are also in place.</p>
