<p>The intertidal flats at Chek Jawa Wetlands are most suitable for visiting
during low tides of 0.5 metres and below, when you will be able to see
most of the marine life. At higher tides, the area will be submerged under
water. Our nature guides will be on hand to bring you on a one-hour tour
to experience Chek Jawaâ€™s amazing natural heritage.</p>
<p>As demand for the guided tours is high, please book early to avoid disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:<br></strong>Each tour costs $60<strong> (maximum 15 people per group)</strong>.
&nbsp;Only online payment will be accepted.&nbsp; In the event that the
tour is cancelled due to inclement weather, your payment will be refunded.</p>
