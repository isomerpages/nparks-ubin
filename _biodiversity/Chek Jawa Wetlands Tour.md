most of the marine life. At higher tides, the area will be submerged under
water. Our nature guides will be on hand to bring you on a one-hour tour
to experience Chek Jawaâ€™s amazing natural heritage.</p>
<p>As demand for the guided tours is high, please book early to avoid disappointment.</p>

&nbsp;Only online payment will be accepted.&nbsp; In the event that the
tour is cancelled due to inclement weather, your payment will be refunded.</p>
