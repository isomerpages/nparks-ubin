<blockquote>
<p><strong>"Ubin to remain as a familiar and rustic getaway, where we can reminisce the past and celebrate the present, where our children can learn about and enjoy thriving biodiversity, where we can come together to enhance its idyllic charm through sustainable means and practices, for future generations of Singaporeans."</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its rustic charm, rich history, lush greenery, and varied biodiversity
make Pulau Ubin a unique sanctuary. Recognising the value of the island
to Singaporeans, the Government has been working with the community over
the years to preserve its natural environment. We are committed to retain
Ubin in its rustic state for as long as possible.
<br>
<br>We want to build on our efforts and further explore ways to sensitively
enhance the island, so that it remains an enjoyable destination for all
Singaporeans –the old, the young and the young at heart – alongside the
flourishing biodiversity.</p>

<h4>The Ubin Project</h4>
<p>Started in 2014, The Ubin Project aims to reach out to as many Singaporeans
as possible to collect ideas and suggestions on how we can build on existing
efforts to sensitively enhance the rustic charm and natural environment
of Pulau Ubin so that the island can continue to be enjoyed by Singaporeans
for generations to come.</p>
<p>To help achieve this, the Friends of Ubin Network (FUN) was formed in
2014. It comprises youths, residents, volunteers, researchers and members
from the heritage and nature communities.</p>
<p>With the collective support of FUN, many of the ideas received have been
implemented. One example is <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/activities/events-and-workshops/2020/9/pesta-ubin-and-ubin-day-2020" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pesta Ubin</a></strong>,
an annual “open house” to bring together groups and individuals who are
passionate about Pulau Ubin. With support from the National Parks Board
(NParks), this ground-up initiative sees various stakeholders organising
activities to share their favourite aspect of the island with the public.</p>
<p>Another idea supported by FUN was to have a single government agency managing
Pulau Ubin. Pulau Ubin was then managed by 12 agencies with technical and
land ownership responsibilities. It was a challenge to holistically address
concerns such as coastal erosion, biodiversity conservation, waste dumping
and ageing infrastructure.</p>
<p>In 2016, NParks was designated as the central managing agency for Pulau
Ubin. The new approach allows NParks to have greater oversight of Pulau
Ubin, to better manage it to achieve The Ubin Project’s vision, and preserve
the island’s rustic charm, natural environment, biodiversity and cultural
heritage. This approach also facilitates better community engagement as
NParks is now the one-stop agency to address stakeholder interests and
public feedback.</p>
<h4>Corporate Partners</h4>
<p>The corporate community has also lent their support towards the vision
to keep Pulau Ubin’s rustic charm for our future generations. Many companies
have stepped forward to provide funding through the <strong><a href="https://www.gardencityfund.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Garden City Fund</a></strong> to
further conservation and outreach projects, and even mobilised their staff
to help out in activities like reforestation, mangrove restoration, coastal
clean-up and nature guiding.
