<h1><strong>The next bound of The Ubin Project</strong></h1>
<p>In 2021, the National Parks Board (NParks) and the Friends of Ubin Network
(FUN) kickstarted discussions to chart the future direction of Pulau Ubin.
Focus group discussions with FUN members were carried out from 2022 to
2023, where they shared their views on suggestions and actionable steps
to develop the next bound of The Ubin Project for the next decade (2024
to 2034). The proposals are in line with the five pillars of The Ubin Project.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Reforestation and forest enrichment programmes&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>
</p>
<p>As part of the Nature Conservation Masterplan, NParks will continue its
reforestation efforts in Pulau Ubin. In 2024, more than 4,500 trees of
over 150 native species will be planted progressively across 18 sites.
They include the Critically Endangered Singapore Kopsia (Kopsia singapurensis),
Pauh Damar (Mangifera pentandra) and Sea Trumpet (Cordia subcordata).&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Introduction of Cinnamon Bush Frog</u>
</p>
<p>The native Cinnamon Bush Frog (<em>Nyctixalus pictus</em>) is a nocturnal
species that mainly lives in terrestrial forests and breeds in phytotelms,
currently listed as Vulnerable in the Singapore Red Data Book. It can be
found in the Bukit Timah and Central Catchment Nature Reserves and their
surrounding Nature Parks. Species recovery efforts will be extended to
Pulau Ubin in 2024, where tadpoles will be collected from mainland Singapore
and introduced to suitable habitats at Pulau Ubin. This will additionally
provide insights into the condition of Ubinâ€™s habitats.</p>
