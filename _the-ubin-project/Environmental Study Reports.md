<p>Pulau Ubin’s coastlines have been affected by coastal erosion in recent
years. This has resulted in the retreat of the shoreline, loss of mangrove
habitats, and damage to areas for public recreation. To mitigate these
impacts and prevent further erosion, NParks will be implementing shoreline
restoration works, which will incorporate both nature-based solutions and
habitat creation strategies:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Headlands with naturalised planting</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beach nourishment</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mangrove shoreline toe protection</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cliff protection and slope stabilisation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restoration works are targeted to begin in 2023. The detailed design has
been completed and the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report for
the works is now ready for public disclosure. The purpose of the EIA is
to assess the potential environmental impacts of the project, including
on the marine water environment and biodiversity.</p>
<p>The EIA has assessed that no significant impacts are predicted for this
project in terms of hydrodynamics, morphology, sediment plume, water quality
and its consequent impacts on aquaculture and recreational facilities,
with the implementation of key mitigation measures during the restoration
works. In terms of biodiversity impact, in the long run, there will be
positive impacts due to the restoration of the shoreline coastal forest
habitat and mangrove habitat. In order to achieve such long-term positive
impacts, there will be minor impacts during the restoration works phase
due to the temporary loss of terrestrial and marine habitat and flora.</p>
<p>Mitigation measures to address potential environmental impacts have been
developed as part of the Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan (EMMP)
in the EIA. The EMMP will be implemented during the restoration works period.</p>
<p>Public feedback for the EIA report was sought&nbsp;from 28 September 2022
to 26 October 2022.</p>
<p>The public feedback period has closed.</p>
