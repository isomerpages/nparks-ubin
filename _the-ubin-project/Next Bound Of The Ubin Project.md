<h1><strong>Next bound of The Ubin Project</strong></h1>
<p>In 2021, the National Parks Board (NParks) and the Friends of Ubin Network
(FUN) kickstarted discussions to chart the future direction of Pulau Ubin.
Focus group discussions with FUN members were carried out from 2022 to
2023, where they shared their views on suggestions and actionable steps
to develop the next bound of The Ubin Project for the next decade (2024
to 2034). The proposals are in line with the five pillars of The Ubin Project.</p>
