<p>In 2021, the National Parks Board (NParks) and the Friends of Ubin Network
(FUN) kickstarted discussions to chart the future direction of Pulau Ubin.
Focus group discussions with FUN members where they shared their views
on suggestions and actionable steps to develop the next bound of The Ubin
Project for the next decade (2024 to 2034). The proposals are in line with
the five pillars of The Ubin Project.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>(1) Biodiversity Conservation</strong>
<br>
<br><u>Reforestation and forest enrichment programmes&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>
</p>
<p>As part of the Nature Conservation Masterplan, NParks will continue its
reforestation efforts in Pulau Ubin. In 2024, more than 4,500 trees of
over 150 native species will be planted progressively across 18 sites.
They include the Critically Endangered Singapore Kopsia (Kopsia singapurensis),
Pauh Damar (Mangifera pentandra) and Sea Trumpet (Cordia subcordata).&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Introduction of Cinnamon Bush Frog</u>
</p>
<p>The native Cinnamon Bush Frog (<em>Nyctixalus pictus</em>) is a nocturnal
species that mainly lives in terrestrial forests and breeds in phytotelms,
currently listed as Vulnerable in the Singapore Red Data Book. It can be
found in the Bukit Timah and Central Catchment Nature Reserves and their
surrounding Nature Parks. Species recovery efforts will be extended to
Pulau Ubin in 2024, where tadpoles will be collected from mainland Singapore
and introduced to suitable habitats at Pulau Ubin. This will additionally
provide insights into the condition of Ubin’s habitats. &nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Mangrove biodiversity survey&nbsp;</u>
</p>
<p>A new in-depth survey of mangroves will be carried out to gather data
on the biodiversity of Pulau Ubin’s mangroves, particularly those in the
central part of the island which constitute the largest contiguous mangrove
area in Singapore. This survey is supported by OCBC as part of their contribution
to the development of the OCBC Mangrove Park at Pulau Ubin. This will help
chart the course for NParks’ future conservation plans on the island and
beyond.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Community, Heritage and History&nbsp;</strong>
<br>
<br><u>Establishment of dedicated Kampung House Restoration Programme&nbsp;</u>
</p>
<p>To adopt a more concerted approach to existing efforts to conserve the
rich cultural heritage of Pulau Ubin, NParks will be implementing a dedicated <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/pulau-ubin/the-ubin-project/ura-design-guidelines-for-kampung-restorations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Kampung House Restoration Programme</a></strong>.
The programme will commence next year with the restoration of five vacant
non-residential kampung houses for community and commercial use.&nbsp;
<br>In an effort to retain the rustic look of the kampung NParks would be
guided by URA Design Guidelines for Kampung Restorations. Click on link

<br>
<br><u>Partner Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to initiate student projects on Pulau Ubin’s rich cultural heritage</u>
</p>
<p>To further document Pulau Ubin’s rich heritage and history, NParks intends
to partner IHLs to initiate student projects on the island. The projects
will aim to showcase Pulau Ubin’s rich cultural heritage and history.</p>

<p><strong>(3) Education and Research</strong>
<br>
<br><u>Nurturing the next generation through the Ubin School initiative</u>
</p>
<p>NParks is rolling out the Ubin School initiative in partnership with Outward
Bound Singapore (OBS) and with the support of various primary and secondary
schools. This initiative will feature a suite of programmes based at the
Ubin Living Lab that incorporate projects under The Ubin Project, involve
the Pulau Ubin community, and celebrate the island’s rich natural and cultural
heritage. The programmes aim to promote environmental education and stewardship
among youths through multi-disciplinary programming and experiential learning.</p>
<p>In the long run, the Workgroup envisions conducting pilot capacity-building
workshops for teachers and tapping on potential collaborators to run the
programmes and benefit more students.</p>

<p><strong>(4) Sustainable design practices&nbsp;</strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>NParks will continue to work with EMA and EDP Renewables to extend the
Micro-Grid beyond the main village to Kampong Sungei Durian to benefit
13 additional households. The use of solar power at Ubin will provide the
villagers with a clean source of energy and lower the island’s carbon footprint,
helping to contribute towards climate change mitigation.</p>

<p><strong>(5) Nature-based recreation</strong>
</p>
<p>NParks will continue to work with FUN to provide amenities on Pulau Ubin
while ensuring they are compatible with the island’s natural environment.
This includes continued efforts to upgrade and enhance interpretive displays
and signage for wayfinding, public safety and enforcement. NParks will
also be conducting trail improvement works on the tracks leading up to
Chek Jawa Wetlands from 1 July to 31 October 2024 to provide visitors with
an improved experience.</p>

<p>NParks and FUN will work closely to continue engaging stakeholders and
the general public on how best to further enhance the island’s rustic and
natural charm, promoting greater community stewardship as Singapore transforms
into a City in Nature.</p>
