<p>Located near Pekan Quarry, this temple was built to serve and provide
convenient access for residents living in the centre, especially those
who have difficulties moving around. Between the 1950s and early 1970s,
the population of the island was about 2,000 when quarrying activity was
at its peak. Three quarters of the residents were Chinese, one quarter
were Malay and the rest were Indian.</p>
<p>This temple and the stage were where all festivities took place.&nbsp;
All the villagers would gather here for prayers and celebrations, according
to the lunar calendar. These include Chinese New Year in the first month,
the God’s birthday in the fifth month, the Hungry Ghost Festival in the
seventh month, and the Mid-autumn (Lantern) Festival in the eighth month.</p>
<p>During such festivities, hawkers would set up street stalls, and traditional
wayang or opera were performed on the stage. These were opportunities for
villagers to meet and catch up with one another. Children also enjoyed
the celebrations as they get to snacks on tidbits that they would not usually
eat and stay out with their friends till late.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The temple and wayang stage continue to host festival celebrations for
the villagers even now. One of the biggest festivities on the island is
the celebration of the deity Tua Peh Kong’s birthday, a 5-day event of
Chinese opera performances, which culminate in a modern “Getai” performance
on the last night!&nbsp; Many old villagers often return, some bringing
their grandchildren, to join in the celebrations and pass on this tradition.</p>
