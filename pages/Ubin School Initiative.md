<p><strong>Ubin School initiative</strong>
</p>
<p>The Ubin School initiative is a suite of programmes based at the Ubin
Living Lab (ULL), with the objective to promote environmental education
and stewardship, while also involving the Ubin community. The framework
of Ubin School was co-developed with the Friends of Ubin Network (FUN)
Educator Workgroup, who saw the value of using Pulau Ubin as an outdoor
learning space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multi-disciplinary lesson plans will be co-created with educators. These
lesson plans will incorporate The Ubin Project initiatives, involve the
Ubin community and also celebrate Ubinâ€™s rich natural and cultural heritage
for generations to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>

schools like Commonwealth Secondary School, Meridian Secondary School,
North Vista Secondary School and Zhangde Primary School, as well as programmes
for teachers from Academy of Singapore Teachers and National Institute
of Education.</p>
<p>Through the Ubin School initiative, participated in activities such as
tree planting under the OneMillionTrees movement, forest monitoring, and
also discovered the rich cultural heritage of Ubin, from its earlier days
used as a quarry and farming, to it now as a home to villagers and biodiversity.</p>
