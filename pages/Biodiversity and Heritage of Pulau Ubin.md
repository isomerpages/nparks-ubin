<h1><strong>A Treasure Trove of Biodiversity&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p>Pulau Ubin is a hotspot for nature lovers due to its rich wildlife. The
National Parks Board (NParks) estimates that the island has over&nbsp;786
native plants, 242 birds, 201 butterflies, 89 mammals, reptiles &amp; amphibians.
Many of these species are very rare and some are not found on mainland
Singapore.</p>
<p>Pulau Ubin is also a key sanctuary for wildlife such as the <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/1/1/11" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Mousedeer</a></strong>,
bats like the <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nparksbuzz/posts/the-ashy-roundleaf-bat-hipposideros-cineraceus-was-first-recorded-on-pulau-ubin-/1960144947358305/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ashy Roundleaf Bat</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/2/1/219" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lesser False Vampire</a></strong>,
and birds like the <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/3/6/36" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Straw-headed Bulbul</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/2/7/276" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mangrove Pitta</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/6/3/630" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Barred Eagle Owl</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/nparksbuzz/nov-issue-2020/conservation/in-the-lonely-'owl'" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Brown Wood Owl</a></strong>.
Pulau Ubin hosts the largest mangrove areas in Singapore and almost all
mangrove plant species known to Singapore can be found here, including
one of the rarest mangrove species in the world, the “<strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/4/0/4002" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Eye of the Crocodile</a></strong>”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of Pulau Ubin’s key attractions is Chek Jawa Wetlands, located on
the eastern coast of the island. It has one of Singapore’s richest ecosystems,
where 6 major habitats meet and mix. Each habitat is home to an abundance
of flora and fauna, such as rare plants as well as local and migratory
birds. The marine biodiversity here is amazing, with about 500 species,
according to NParks’ records.</p>
<p>NParks runs a visitor centre at Chek Jawa with a viewing jetty, over 1
km of boardwalk and a 21-metre tall viewing tower. Chek Jawa is also home
to Singapore’s only 2 mangrove Heritage Trees, which are listed in the
Heritage Tree Register of Singapore. Known as <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/4/7/4739" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Perepat</a></strong> or
Mangrove Apple, they are possibly two of the biggest in Singapore.</p>
<p>NParks and its volunteers carry out on-going field research and monitoring
studies, including plant surveys, seagrass monitoring, bird ringing and
camera trapping. Habitat enhancement efforts like reforestation, restoration
of mangroves and rehabilitation of freshwater ponds, as well as species
recovery projects like the <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/-/media/cuge/ebook/citygreen/cg4/cg4_14.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=0463E2630FB091E0BE1AA5B6AEA70AD27CC43FF0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Hornbill Project</a></strong> and
Butterfly Hill, are also in place.</p>

<h2>Kampong Life</h2>
<p><strong>Ubin of Yesteryears</strong>
</p>
<p>Pulau Ubin was formerly a cluster of 5 smaller islands separated by tidal
rivers. Local Malays once called the island "Pulau Batu Jubin" or "Granite
Stone island". This is because, in the old days, the granite from the island
was quarried to make floor tiles or jubin in Malay. The name of the island
was later shortened to Pulau Ubin.
<br>In the 16th century, Ubin was part of the Johor-Riau Empire. The earliest
inhabitants of the island were the Orang Laut (or “Sea People”) and indigenous
Malays of Bugis and Javanese origins.</p>

Corporation (now MediaCorp) in 1990.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Age of Granite Mining</strong>
</p>
<p>By the mid-1800s, a sizable Chinese community moved to the island to work
at the quarries. Pulau Ubin became a hotbed for granite quarrying. The
granite was used for the construction of the Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra
Branca completed in 1851, Fort Canning in 1858 and the Causeway in 1923.
Many Kheks (Chinese dialect group) also settled on the central and western
parts of the island, adding to the vast labour force which worked at the
quarries.
<br>Granite quarrying activities on Pulau Ubin peaked in the 1930s when private
quarries operated on the island. Besides granite quarrying, the island
was also opened up for commercial crop cultivation. Coffee, nutmeg, pineapple,
coconut, durian, tobacco and rubber plantations were started at different
times across the island.
<br>Other activities included prawn farming, fishing and poultry rearing.</p>

<br>
<br><strong>Rise of the Ubin Inhabitants</strong>
</p>
<p>During the 1880s, around 50 Malay families from the Kallang River in mainland
Singapore moved to Pulau Ubin to be fishermen. The movement of workers
and settlers from Singapore added to the population of Pulau Ubin. It led
to the proliferation of kampongs on the island. Kampongs were established
near the northern coast at Kampong Noordin, Kampong Bahru, Kampong Mamam
and Kampong Petai, while Kampong Chek Jawa developed in the eastern side
of the island.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Pulau Ubin's "Kepala"</strong>
</p>
<p>As the population grew larger, the original inhabitants and the new settlers
to Pulau Ubin soon had to deal with the issue of maintaining social order
on the island. The original inhabitants resented the arrival of more and
more newcomers. Furthermore, a number of Chinese immigrants to the island
were members of Chinese secret societies and they brought with them their
rivalries from Singapore. There were frequent clashes as each secret society
claimed to be the “kepala” (head) in Pulau Ubin. The violence ended only
after the Japanese occupied the island during the Second World War.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Decline of Granite Mining</strong>
</p>
<p>By the 1970s, the granite mining industry began to decline. The last operational
quarry on the island closed in 1999. Commercial crop cultivation and rubber
tapping on Pulau Ubin officially ceased in the 1980s.
<br>The population on the island gradually dwindled with the closure of granite
quarries. During the 1950s to early 1970s, the island had over 2,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p><strong>Ubin Today-Traditional Lifestyle</strong>
</p>
<p>Pulau Ubin retains much of its 1960s charming kampong setting. With its
wooden kampong houses and scenic winding forest paths, it offers visitors
a unique off-the-beaten-track experience. About 38 villagers continue to
live on the island, such as the family of the late village head, Lim Chye
Joo, and Madam Samsiah Abdullah, who lives in her 100-year-old kampong
home. These villagers depend on traditional farming and fishing for subsistence,
while others run provision stores, eateries and bicycle rental shops to
support the tourist trade.
<br>In the Ubin village, aside from the restaurants and bicycle rental kiosks,
one can also find an old Wayang (“Chinese Opera”) stage and a colourful
Chinese temple built in 1969. The former farms, rubber plantations and
the now abandoned quarries allow visitors to enjoy a variety of sights
around the island.</p>
<p>In true kampong-style living, there is no tap water or electricity provided
on Pulau Ubin. Residents obtain their water supply from wells, and operate
diesel generators for electricity. In 2013, the Energy Market Authority
(EMA) embarked on a micro grid test-bed using solar panels and biodiesel
to generate electricity in a less pollutive and more environmentally sustainable
manner for residents and businesses at the jetty area.</p>
