<p>House 363B was owned by Mr Chew Teck Seng, a local provision shop owner
from 1970 to 2005. It was home to three generations of his family. The
Chew family used to pursue poultry farming, vegetable farming and ran a
provision shop in the village centre know as the 'Teck Seng Provision Shop'
that supplied the canteens around the various quarries located around Pulau
Ubin as a source of income. The house was returned to state in 2005 when
Mr Chew's family resettled to mainland Singapore.</p>
<p>The house has since been conserved and refurbished as a model Chinese
kampong house. The original architecture was retained and minimal changes
were made to conserve its rustic charm. The house now serves as an immersive
"museum" that takes guests back in time to life on Pulau Ubin during the
1970s. Many items in the house, including furniture, appliances, kitchen
utensils and photograph were donated by past and residents, as well as
friends of Pulau Ubin.</p>
