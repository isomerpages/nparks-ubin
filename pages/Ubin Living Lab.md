<p>Located at the former Celestial Resort site in the southwest of Pulau
Ubin, the 2.1-hectare Ubin Living Lab (ULL) was opened in November 2016.
ULL is an integrated facility dedicated to support research and field studies,
environmental education and community outreach. The concept and design
were conceived through shared suggestions from stakeholders and members
of the community collected since 2014.</p>
<p>The Main Block houses a field-studies laboratory, meeting and seminar
rooms, as well as two dormitories. There is also an NParks office and first-aid
room for visitors who need assistance.&nbsp;Located on the other side of
a lake is the Hall Block. This includes a multipurpose hall to facilitate
group activities and a dedicated space with wood-working equipment and
work benches to support restoration work of kampung houses by the community.
Fronting the lake is the Endut Senin Campsite&nbsp;that can accommodate
up to about 100 campers.</p>

<p>ULL also has a mangrove arboretum, which showcases a living collection
of mangrove plant species native to Singapore. This arboretum will serve
as a valuable reference resource for students and researchers. Also, it
will provide seeds and propagules for ongoing habitat enhancement efforts
elsewhere in Ubin.</p>

<p>Since 2014, members of the community have shared suggestions and feedback
on the development of ULL. When completed, the total area of ULL will span
5.4 hectares. Future phases of ULL will include the planning and implementation
of pilot projects for sustainable design and practices in potable water
supply, waste management, electrical power supply, as well as green buildings.
In the interim, NParks is also working with partner organisations to implement
water treatment systems to provide potable water for visitors to ULL and
public toilets on Pulau Ubin.</p>
<p>The rustic surroundings provide students with a suitable platform to engage
in experiential learning while playing their part in conserving Singaporeâ€™s
biodiversity. Educators and research groups who wish to use the facility
