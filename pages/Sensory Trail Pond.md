<p>NParks had worked with Ngee Ann Polytechnic students to complete habitat
enhancement works at the Sensory Trail ponds. Formerly used for fish farming,
the four ponds have been combined into a single waterbody to provide habitats
for biodiversity. The students helped to design and implement the planting
plan for fauna such as waterhens, crakes, herons, kingfishers, dragonflies
and damselflies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The studentsâ€™ planting plan involved several aspects of attracting biodiversity.
Snags salvaged from fallen trees were used as perches for birds to rest
and hunt. Plants that provide shelter and suitable habitats were selected,
such as Grey Sedge (<strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/4/3/4372" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lepironia articulata</a></em></strong>)<em>,&nbsp;</em>Singapore
rhododendron (<strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/2/2/2221" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Melastoma malabathricum</a></em></strong>)<em> </em>and
Rough Horsetail (<strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/1/5/1550" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Equisetum hyemale</a></em></strong>).
Some aquatic birds also use the plants to hide from other predatory animals.</p>
