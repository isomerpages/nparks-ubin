<p>Situated along Jalan Ubin, the fruit tree arboretum on Pulau Ubin will
be the first of its kind in Singapore. Named ‘Ubin Fruit Orchard’, the
site was previously a fruit orchard belonging to a resident on the island.
About one hectare in size, the arboretum will feature a collection of some
350 fruit trees that were once commonly planted in kampungs. Visitors can
expect to see over 30 species of trees including rambutan and starfruit.
The arboretum will also showcase uncommon cultivars of durian and mango.
Students from Nanyang Girls’ High prepared interpretive signs and students
from Ngee Ann Polytechnic assisted with planting works for the arboretum.</p>
