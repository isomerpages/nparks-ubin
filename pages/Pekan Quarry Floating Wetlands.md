<p>Over the years, Pekan Quarry has transformed from a bleak disused quarry,
into a thriving freshwater wetland habitat, home to a variety of fauna
and flora.&nbsp;As part of the habitat enhancement programme, floating
wetlands were first introduced to Pekan Quarry in 2015 as a pilot initiative
to increase the area of usable wildlife habitat. Since then, three more
bigger floating wetlands have been installed, serving as nesting and roosting
sites. These floating wetlands have been successful in increasing the area
of usable wildlife habitat, from the edges of the quarry to the water surface
itself. Herons, kingfishers, waterhens, otters, as well as dragonflies
and damselflies have been observed to be using these floating wetlands.</p>
<h3><strong>Importance of Freshwater Wetlands</strong></h3>
<p>Wetlands provide many benefits to the ecosystem. Wetland plants filter
sediments from the water and some can even remove heavy metals and other
pollutions as well, helping to prevent the contamination of downstream
water bodies.</p>
<p>Many animals and plants depend on the wetlands for survival. Plants provide
ideal nesting places and food for birds and other small animals, while
the fauna in turn help to disperse seeds.</p>
<h3><strong>Creation of the Floating Wetlands</strong></h3>

<p>Four large clusters of floating wetlands have been deployed in Pekan Quarry.
Together, they cover a combined area of 4,000 m2, the size of about eight
basketball courts. The foundation of the wetlands consists of hexagon-shaped
modules made with highly durable High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and developed
by the Housing Development Board. Each module can bear a load of up to
80kg but is lightweight, scalable and can be pieced together to form large
natural shapes of islands. The module has a hole in the middle, for the
planting of freshwater wetland plants. A layer of soil is laid on the surface
and floating mats attached to the module’s edges provide a stable surface
for wildlife to climb on or forage from. Logs, snags and sandy areas are
added to create more areas for animals to perch on and bask.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Heron Nesting Platforms</strong></h3>
<p>These platforms were installed to replicate the natural nesting sites
of herons and cater to the various species that have different height preferences
when looking for suitable places to build a nest. Some of the herons that
are commonly sighted roosting on the platforms includes the Grey Heron
(<em>Ardea cinerea</em>), Black-crowned Night Heron (<em>Nycticorax nycticorax</em>),
Purple Heron (<em>Ardea purpurea</em>) and Great-billed Heron (<em>Ardea sumatrana</em>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nesting platforms have been installed on the floating wetlands to encourage
herons to nest. The Pekan Quarry Citizen Science Bird Survey is an NParks
Youth Steward for Nature (YSN) initiative to involve the public in monitoring
the number of birds using the nesting platforms. Relevant tide levels can
be extracted to see how it is associated with bird roosting activity on
the nesting platforms. Such data analytics will help in formulating future
conservation strategies. Over a year, results and observations will be
uploaded on this webpage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope you will visit the floating wetlands at Pekan Quarry and contribute
to this survey by submitting your observations via the online form available
at the look-out point.</p>
