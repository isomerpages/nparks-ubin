<p>Chek Jawa Wetlands is located at the eastern end of Pulau Ubin, about
3 km away from the public jetty at Pulau Ubin. You can hire a van or rent
a bicycle from the main village, or the more adventurous, can take a 40
min walk to Chek Jawa from the jetty.</p>
<p>Covering approximately 100 hectares in area, Chek Jawa is a unique natural
area, where six major ecosystems â€“ sandy beach, rocky beach, seagrass lagoon,
coral rubble, mangroves and coastal forest - meet!</p>
<p>Pulau Ubin's value for biodiversity conservation is highlighted by the
recognition of a new plant species, named <strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/7/2/7288" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Utania nervosa</a></em></strong>.
The <em>Utania nervosa</em> was discovered at Chek Jawa in 1997, and was
previously called "<em>Fagraea racemosa</em>", having been confused with
a much more common tree species that is native from Indo-China to Thailand,
Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. This new species was published in the
international journal Plant Ecology and Evolution in July 2014, in effect
becoming Singapore's newest species! <em>Utania nervosa</em> is known only
from a very restricted area including southeast Johor and the Singapore
islands of Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong. Its known habitats in Johor are
marginal sites in degraded swampland.</p>
<p>To create greater access to Chek Jawa, visitor facilities were put in
place since July 2007, such as a visitor centre with a viewing jetty, a
1km boardwalk (Mangrove and Coastal Loops), and a 21 m viewing tower called
the Jejawi Tower. This development constitutes part of a long-term sustainable
visitor management plan to protect the rich biodiversity. Visitors can
conduct their own DIY tour along the boardwalks to appreciate the rich
biodiversity at Chek Jawa seven days a week, between 9.00 am and 5.00 pm.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About Chek Jawa</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br>One of Singapore's richest ecosystems, Chek Jawa is a unique natural area
where six major habitats meet and mix.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Slated for land reclamation in 1992, the wonderful secrets of Chek Jawa
were unveiled only in December 2000. As public attention was drawn to this
site, thousands of Singaporeans flocked to visit this wetland treasure.
At the same time, appeals from nature lovers and the general public led
to a review of its reclamations plans.
<br>
<br>After carefully considering all public submissions and extensive consultations
with scientific experts and relevant government agencies, it was announced
in 2001 that reclamation works would be deferred for as long as Pulau Ubin
is not required for development.&nbsp;
