<p>Located at the entrance of Chek Jawa, the visitor centre was converted
from a Tudor-style house built in the 1930s. Fondly known as House No.
1 (its postal address in Ubin), the building was awarded conservation status
by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) in December 2003, and was carefully
restored.</p>
<p>One of the unique features of the house is its original fireplace, which
is probably the only one left in Singapore. The fireplace is no longer
in use and is closed off as a family of <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/5/6/564" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Pouched Tomb bats&nbsp;(</a><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/5/6/564" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Saccholaimus saccholaimus</a></em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/5/6/564" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">)</a></strong> currently
reside in the chimney of the house. Another rare species of <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/2/1/219" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Malayan False Vampire bats (</a><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/2/1/219" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Megaderma spasma</a></em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/2/1/219" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">)</a></strong> can
also be found in an old water tower just beside the house. The water tower
and the bats were not disturbed, and a new water tank was constructed for
use instead.
<br>The ground level of the visitor centre houses showcase information panels
and interpretive displays that depict the history and beauty of the natural
heritage in Chek Jawa.</p>
