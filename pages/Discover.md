<p>Get up close and personal with nature and greenery when you embark on
a walking or cycling trail in Pulau Ubin. As you do so, please stay safe
and help to conserve our environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Stay on designated trails.</strong>&nbsp;Avoid stepping off track
while on our nature trails. By stepping off the trails, you risk disturbing
and trampling on our flora and fauna.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Maintain a distance away from wildlife.</strong>&nbsp;Do resist
the temptation to follow or approach any wildlife. Appreciate the wildlife
from afar and maintain a safe distance from them. Kindly refrain from feeding
them as this can affect their health and alter their natural behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Respect the eco-system.</strong>&nbsp;Please refrain from feeding
native or stray animals, or releasing animals into our parks and nature
reserves. Doing so may upset our fragile eco-system and cause more harm
than good.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Safety during bad weather.&nbsp;</strong>Seek cover at the nearest
shelter available and avoid entering forested areas, including nature reserves
and nature parks during and immediately after bad weather. Visit&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.weather.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NEA</a></strong>&nbsp;or
dial 65427788 for the weather forecast.</p>
