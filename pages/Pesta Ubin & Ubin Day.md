<p>Since 2017, Pesta Ubin is a yearly event for Pulau Ubin volunteers and
stakeholders to come together as
<br>one community to celebrate the island’s timeless beauty, natural and cultural
heritage. It is a four-week
<br>celebration with exciting and enlightening activities organised for and
by the community. Open to the
<br>public, it gives visitors the opportunity to learn about life on the island,
enjoy the island’s unique charm and discover its wildlife.</p>
<p>Pesta Ubin is made possible by the passionate members of the Friends of
Ubin Network (FUN), with the support of the NParks.</p>
