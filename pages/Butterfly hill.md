<p>Butterfly Hill, a knoll created specially to conserve and showcase butterflies,
attracts about 140 species of butterflies. It is about a football field
in size.</p>
<p>It is a successful model of how the community can be involved in nature
conservation efforts. Local butterfly expert, Khew Sin Khoon, provided
advice on how to plant over 50 butterfly- attracting plant species. Some
of these were “nectaring” plants whose flowers provide energy-rich nectar
for adult butterflies, while others were “host” plants fed upon by caterpillars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The butterfly species that can be spotted at Butterfly Hill include the <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/9/5/957" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Blue Glassy Tiger</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/9/5/956" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Black Veined Tiger</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/9/3/934" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Common Bluebottle</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/1/0/1032" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Cycad Blue</a></strong>.
Rarities include the <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/3/2/326" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Common Jay</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/3/3/331" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Dwarf Crow</a></strong>&nbsp;(above).
The latter species was previously presumed to be extinct from Singapore.
This species was only rediscovered in 2002 from Pulau Ubin and is so far
known only from this locality. Species previously not recorded from Pulau
Ubin like the <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/3/2/325" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Common Birdwing</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/3/2/327" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Common Rose</a></strong>,
have also been attracted to the hill and are now a common sight.</p>
