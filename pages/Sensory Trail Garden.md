<p>Experience Ubin's wonderful nature through your different senses along
our Sensory Trail. It is an easy walk and takes about 1 hour to complete.
It will take you through the backyard planting of the Pulau Ubin village
home, where some fruit trees such as papaya, banana, rambutan and breadfruit
etc are planted. You can see the different vegetables, spices and herbs
that the villagers used to plant for their own consumption. You will also
get to know the economic crops that are important to Pulau Ubin in the
1970s. This is an excellent introduction to the rustic and natural character
of the island.</p>
