<p>Get up close and personal with nature and greenery when you embark on
a walking or cycling trail in Pulau Ubin. As you do so, please stay safe
and help to conserve our environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Stay on designated trails.</strong>&nbsp;Avoid stepping off track
while on our nature trails. By stepping off the trails, you risk disturbing
and trampling on our flora and fauna.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Maintain a distance away from wildlife.</strong>&nbsp;Do resist
the temptation to follow or approach any wildlife. Appreciate the wildlife
from afar and maintain a safe distance from them. Kindly refrain from feeding
them as this can affect their health and alter their natural behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Respect the eco-system.</strong>&nbsp;Please refrain from feeding
native or stray animals, or releasing animals into our parks and nature
reserves. Doing so may upset our fragile eco-system and cause more harm
than good.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Safety during bad weather.&nbsp;</strong>Seek cover at the nearest
shelter available and avoid entering forested areas, including nature reserves
and nature parks. Before your visit, remember to check the weather forecast.
We also encourage you to subscribe to the <a href="https://www.weather.gov.sg/warning-heavy-rain" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Meteorological Service Singapore's Heavy Rain Warnings</a> to
