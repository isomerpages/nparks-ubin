<p>The Ubin School initiative is a suite of programmes based at the Ubin
Living Lab (ULL), with the objective to promote environmental education
and stewardship, while also involving the Ubin community. The framework
of Ubin School was co-developed with the Friends of Ubin Network (FUN)
Educator Workgroup, who saw the value of using Pulau Ubin as an outdoor
learning space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multi-disciplinary lesson plans will be co-created with educators. These
lesson plans will incorporate The Ubin Project initiatives, involve the
Ubin community and also celebrate Ubin’s rich natural and cultural heritage
for generations to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Tapping on citizen science for habitat enhancement efforts</h4>
<p>To transform Pulau Ubin into a learning classroom set in nature, the Ubin
School initiative is tapping on citizen science to support habitat enhancement
efforts for Pulau Ubin. For example, in 2024 and 2025, students from Meridian
Secondary School contributed to the monitoring of reforestation sites on
the island by tagging the planted trees and measuring their height and
girth, supporting long-term ecological data collection.</p>
<p>This complements other ongoing habitat enhancement efforts with students,
such as coastal clean-ups and invasive species management.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Experiential learning through interactions with Ubin villagers</h4>
<p>Several learning journeys conducted this year have involved members of
the Pulau Ubin community. For instance, as part of their learning journey
on the changing landscapes of Pulau Ubin and the relationship between the
island and its villagers, students from North Vista Secondary School’s
Outdoor Activities Club visited a kampung house and interacted with a villager
to understand the Ubin way of life. During their visit, students learnt
about the cultivation of fruit trees and medicinal herbs and had the opportunity
to experience drawing water from traditional wells. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, as part of Commonwealth Secondary School’s STEM elective, Secondary
3 and 4 students learnt about sustainable practices on the island by observing
the villagers’ daily routines.</p>
