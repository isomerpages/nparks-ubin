<p>Visitors come to Pulau Ubin experience the islandâ€™s much-loved rusticity.
We have in place safety measures on the island, including first-aid posts
at Ubin Volunteer Hub in the Main Village and at the Ubin Living Lab. These
first-aid posts are manned daily by staff trained to administer first-aid.
The Singapore Red Cross also sends their volunteers on the second Sunday
of each month, to help with cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visitors may approach any of these first-aid posts should they require
medical assistance. We have also worked with the Police Coast Guard and
the Singapore Civil Defence Force on emergency evacuation arrangements
should the need arise.&nbsp;In case of any emergency or accident,&nbsp;<strong>visitors can call 999/995 or the NParks helpline at 1800-471 7300</strong>.&nbsp;The
locations of the first aid posts, and the numbers to call for emergency
assistance are indicated on our map boards situated at various locations
on the island.</p>
<p>We recommend that cyclists rent helmets from the bicycle shops on Ubin
or bring their own. At some areas with steeper slopes, there are signs
to inform cyclists to dismount and push their bicycles for their own safety.</p>
