<p>Shaped like a boomerang, Pulau Ubin is situated just off the north-eastern
corner of mainland Singapore. Once a cluster of five smaller islets separated
by tidal rivers, it has since been united by the building of bunds for
prawn farming to become a single 1,020-hectare island. Two other islets,
Pulau Ketam (Crab Island) and Pulau Sekudu (Frog Island), lie to its south.</p>
<p>In the early days, granite mining supported a few thousand settlers. Much
of the original vegetation was cleared for the cultivation of rubber and
crops like coffee, pineapple, coconut and jasmine. Today, abandoned granite
quarries remain as picturesque relics of Ubin's history, while forests
and grasslands have regenerated to cover up the ravages of the past.</p>

<p><strong>Life on Ubin</strong>
</p>
<p>Be transported back in time to 1960s Singapore as you embark on a trip
to nearby Pulau Ubin. Home to one of Singapore’s last villages or kampongs,
the island still retains the rustic beauty and simplicity of a bygone era.
Learn more about this kampong community through the <strong><a href="http://www.nhb.gov.sg/~/media/nhb/files/media/releases/new%20releases/media%20release%20pulau%20ubin%20final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cultural Mapping by National Heritage Board</a></strong>
</p>
<p>Wander along the many trails and see how the local residents live. With
no access to modern and efficient public utilities on mainland Singapore,
the villagers rely on wells for water and noisy diesel generators for electricity.
For subsistence, they depend on traditional farming and fishing.</p>
<p>Adrenaline junkies and thrill seekers can rent mountain bikes from the
many rental shops at the main village, near the jetty, and embark on a
thrilling and exhilarating ride across the island’s rugged terrain. Don’t
forget to stop by the quarry to enjoy the mesmerising beauty of the undulating
granite hills and stunning views of the aqua-coloured lake.</p>
<p>Before you head back to mainland Singapore, stop by the provision stores
or eateries and tuck into some scrumptious kampong cuisine.</p>
