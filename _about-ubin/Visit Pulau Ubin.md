<p><strong>Eating in Ubin</strong>
<br>
<br>There are four restaurants operating in Pulau Ubin.</p>
<p>Just next to the Ubin Jetty, Encik Hassan's shop has been around for more
than 30 years. The shop was not operating for a while and resume operation
on weekends recently. The shop sells homemade malay dishes like mee rebus,
mee siam and nasi lemak.
<br>
<br>'Cheong Lian Yuen' is the another food establishment that is near to the
Ubin jetty. It serves seafood and has a small alfresco dining area in front
of the restaurant.
<br>
<br>Opposite the Wayang stage, there is a small restaurant, 'Sin Nam Huat',
which features snapshots of Ubin history all over the wall. run by two
sisters, it serves seafood and traditional 'Kopi' (coffee) and 'Teh' (tea).
<br>
<br>Along the road towards Ubin Volunteer Hub is another seafood restaurant.
'Season Live Seafood Restaurant'. It has an alfresco dining area which
offers a sea view facing the Ubin Jetty and mainland Singapore.
<br>
<br>Shops at the Ubin Village centre sell refreshments like snacks, drinks
and desserts like chendol, ice kacang and ice cream. Seasonal fruits like
durian, rambutan, mangosteens, chempedak are also sold at the provision

<p><strong>Other drinks stall around Ubin</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Ah Ma Drink Stall</strong>
</p>
<p>Situated just before the Jelutong Bridge, a former sluice gate for a prawn
farm, the "Ah Ma Drink Stall" stall is managed by Madam Ong Ang Kui &nbsp;and
her daughter. Ong was born and raised in Ubin and still lives in a house
with more than 90 durian trees that were planted by her late husband. Today,
she sells drinks and fruit from these trees at her stall.</p>
<p><strong>Kampong Durian</strong>
</p>
<p>You can find traditional Malay&nbsp;<em>kampung</em>&nbsp;houses on the
eastern part of the island. During the 1880s, Encik Endun Senin initiated
a major migration project to resettle inhabitants from the Kallang River
area on the mainland to Pulau Ubin. About 50 families settled around the
South-eastern coast of the island at&nbsp;<em>Kampung</em>&nbsp;(Kg) Durian,
Kg Melayu, Kg Sungei Durian and Kg Surau. Most of them were fishermen.</p>
<p>The Malay houses were either built on raised platforms, which allows for
greater ventilation, or on the ground, or a combination of both. The houses
are built on timber posts and have timber walls. Attap-thatched roofs (made
from Nipah palm leaves) used to be common but have since been converted
to corrugated zinc roofs or clip-lock metal roofs. Elevated, these houses
avoid contact with the dirt from the ground and flooding from the adjacent
mangrove. The veranda is ideal for neighbourly social gathering.</p>
<p>The casement windows have timber railings. Often, colourful curtains are
parted at the centre and are secured at mid-length. The timber panel wall
tops are also laced with decorative timber grilles.The master bedrooms
are usually on raised platforms while the dining rooms, kitchens, and toilets
are built on the ground.</p>
<p>You can stop here for a break and have a drink from one the houses. The
owner usually operates during weekend.&nbsp;</p>
