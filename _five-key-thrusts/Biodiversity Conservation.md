<p>Pulau Ubin is a 1,000-hectare boomerang-shaped island situated northeast
of mainland Singapore. It comprises different habitat types: mangroves,
rocky and sandy shores, coastal and secondary forests, abandoned fruit
plantations, scrubland and freshwater ponds. These habitats support a rich
diversity of wildlife.</p>
<p>In March 2014, the government launched the plan to sensitively enhance
and conserve Pulau Ubin, which gave rise to The Ubin Project. Some of the
ideas under The Ubin Project were contributed by the public and reviewed
through FUN members. Among these ideas, initiatives such as species recovery
projects and habitat enhancement were put forth and implemented.</p>
<h4><strong>Species Recovery Projects</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Bats</strong>
</p>
<p>Pulau Ubin is home to several bat species, including the Critically Endangered
Ashy Roundleaf Bat (<strong><em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nparksbuzz/posts/the-ashy-roundleaf-bat-hipposideros-cineraceus-was-first-recorded-on-pulau-ubin-/1960144947358305/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hipposideros cineraceus</a></em></strong>)
and the Lesser False Vampire (<strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/2/1/219" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Megaderma spasma</a></em></strong>),
which are currently not found in mainland Singapore.</p>
<p>Bat houses have been constructed to supplement their available roosting
sites. These bat houses were designed as tower-like structures with rough
interior surfaces that bats can grip on.</p>
<p>Bat boxes of six different designs have been placed around different habitats
around Pulau Ubin to attract different bat species. Three of these bat
boxes were designed by students from Republic Polytechnic and one of them
was constructed by students from ITE College East.</p>

<p><strong>Birds</strong>
</p>
<p>Three bird species have been selected for species recovery in Pulau Ubin
- the Baya Weaver (<strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/7/9/797" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ploceus philippinus</a></em></strong>),
Blue-throated Bee-eater (<strong><em><a href="http://https//www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/5/9/595" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Merops viridis</a></em></strong>)
and Red-wattled Lapwing (<strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/1/7/171" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vanellus indicus</a></em></strong>).</p>
<p>Safeguarding nesting as well as roosting sites are important to increase
the long term survival for these birds in Singapore. A site adjacent to
Ketam Quarry has been converted into a bird nesting area with conditions
suitable for all three species.</p>
<p>The male Baya Weaver builds distinctive hanging nests with a central bulbous
chamber on drooping tree branches. This makes it difficult for predators
to raid the nest for eggs or chicks. The provision of suitable trees for
such nests is therefore essential.</p>
<p>The Blue-throated Bee-eater builds its nest on the ground or on a slope
face. The bird burrows into a tunnel and creates a chamber at the end where
it breeds. Mounds of sand have been built with artificial nest boxes inserted
into them, creating more nesting sites for Bee-eaters. Built by ITE College
East students, these nest boxes simulate the size and tilt of the natural
bee-eater's nest.</p>

<p><strong>Otters</strong>
</p>
<p>The Asian Small-clawed Otter (<strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/2/2/225" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aonyx cinereus</a></em></strong>)
lives in small groups, inhabiting small rivers ad mangrove streams. Its
diet comprises mainly of crustaceans such as crabs and shrimps. This Critically
Endangered species is rarely seen unlike the more frequently encountered
Smooth-coated Otter (<strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/1/3/13" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lutra perspicillata</a></em></strong>).</p>
<p>In November 2016, artificial holts or dens have been installed in areas
where the Asian Small-clawed Otter is known to occur so as to aid the recovery
of its numbers. These holts are designed to resemble natural holts and
placed above the high tide mark. The holt also has more than one means
of entry and exit, allowing the otter to escape if it feels threatened.</p>
<p>In early 2018, an Asian Small-clawed Otter family was spotted using the
holts! Click <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nparksbuzz/videos/asian-small-clawed-otter-family-at-pulau-ubin/211300593130896/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a></strong> to

<p><strong>Orchids</strong>
</p>
<p>Pulau Ubin is one of the many sites chosen for the reintroduction of Critically
Endangered native orchids. Epiphytic species that have been planted include <strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/5/9/5997" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Phalaenopsis cornu-cervi</a></em></strong> and <strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/4/9/4955" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bulbophyllum medusae</a></em></strong>.
The establishment and growth of the orchids are closely monitored regularly.</p>

<p><strong>Mangrove Trees</strong>
</p>
<p>The Eye of the Crocodile (<strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/4/0/4002" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bruguiera hainesii</a></em></strong>)
is one of the rarest mangrove trees, with only about 200 left worldwide.
A total of 13 trees are found and over 20 saplings have been planted on
the island.</p>

<h4><strong>Habitat Enhancement Projects</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Pekan Quarry Floating Wetlands</strong>
</p>
<p>In the past, Pulau Ubin was used for agriculture and granite quarrying,
which affected the quality of existing habitats and led to the creation
of new environments (namely granite quarries) that were less conducive
for native wildlife. Habitat enhancement is employed to modify sites to
increase the quality of the site or to produce conditions that did not
use to exist so that biodiversity can thrive. Habitat enhancement projects
include shoreline restoration, reforestation and freshwater habitat enrichment.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Sensory Trail Pond</strong>
</p>
<p>Four former fish farming ponds at the Sensory Trail were combined into
a single waterbody, where floating wetlands were installed, attracting
various birds and animals such as waterhens, crakes, herons, kingfishers,
dragonfilies, and damselflies.</p>

<h4><strong>Environmental Studies Reports</strong></h4>
<p>Environmental studies are conducted where required to determine and mitigate
the potential impact of any new development on the environment. Please
