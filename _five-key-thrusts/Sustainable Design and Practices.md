<p>To maintain and conserve Pulau Ubin’s rich cultural and natural heritage,
development on the island need to be sustainable with minimal impact on
the environment. Old kampong needing refurbishment would be restored sustainably
to conserve Ubin’s history and cultural heritage. Visitors are also encouraged
to be ecologically and socially responsible through the Ubin Way’s code
of conduct. Through the various initiatives by NParks working with Friends
of Ubin Network (FUN), we hope for Pulau Ubin to retain its cultural and
natural heritage, and rustic character of the island - from introducing
visitors to the Ubin Way to having sustainable architecture built and restoration
works done. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Ubin Way</h4>
<p>Initiated and drawn up by the FUN, the Ubin Way is a code of conduct guiding
ecologically and socially responsible behaviour on Pulau Ubin, so that
the island can continue to be enjoyed by all. Signs advocating the Ubin
Way have been installed at several locations around the island, and a video
promoting it is screened at the Changi Point Ferry Terminal, and available
on the National Parks Board’s website as well. In support of the Ubin Way,
many event organisers also bring the trash generated from their activities
out of the island. Others have even pledged their commitment towards “zero
waste” activities through actions like not providing disposable plastic
bottles of water and requiring participants to bring their own reusable
bottles which can be filled with water from water dispensers. Collectively,
stakeholders have also promoted the appreciation of our cultural and natural
heritage by organising guided tours for the public.</p>
<h4>Pulau Ubin Micro-grid Test-bed</h4>
<p>The Energy Market Authority launched a micro-grid test-bed at the jetty
area of Pulau Ubin in October 2013. Useful information such as the reliability
of an electricity supply within a micro-grid infrastructure using solar
photovoltaic (PV) technology can be obtained through this test-bed. As
solar energy remains the most viable source of renewable energy for Singapore,
these insights will prepare Singapore when solar energy forms a significant
part of our renewable energy mix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The test-bed benefits more than 30 residents and businesses around the
jetty area who previously used diesel generators to supply electricity.
These generators were noisy, expensive to maintain and prone to frequent
breakdowns. With the micro-grid, Pulau Ubin residents and businesses now
enjoy a cheaper, cleaner and more reliable supply of electricity, and they
have less worries about an unstable power source.</p>
<h4>Restoration of kampong houses on Pulau Ubin</h4>
<p>NParks will help interested groups connect with experts in architecture,
heritage and related fields as well as volunteer networks through FUN to
work on this project.&nbsp;Enhancements will be done sensitively, using
sustainable design and practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ah Ma Drink Stall</strong>
</p>
<p>Ah Ma Drink Stall Project is a timber design and build reconstruction
project on Pulau Ubin, a small island off mainland Singapore.&nbsp;This
project is a collective effort of multiple stakeholders, including NUS
Architecture, PH consulting, Singapore Heritage Society, Sea Angel, National
Parks Board and Ministry of National Development. This pilot project aims
to ease the future restoration in Ubin and the preservation and revitalization
of the last kampong in Singapore.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old original drink stall was a makeshift construction by Ah
Ma’s late husband and family, but slowly deteriorated into a structurally
unsafe building due to ground settlement. The reconstruction helps the
80-year old Ubin resident, Ah Ma, to continue her resilient and independent
lifestyle on Pulau Ubin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design was through a participatory process and the construction involved
local villagers transferring vernacular construction knowledge of interlocking
timber joinery to students. Sentimental values are well respected. Original
spatial arrangement and architectural language of columns and pitched roof
are adopted. Some original timber planks are reused in the new construction
to keep traces of the past. Signboards written by the late husband are
hung on prominent locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drink stall is located next to a tidal river, resulted in occasional
super tides which would flood the stall. Raised platform at seat height
is incorporated to address this issue. Based on the meeting with kayakers,
we understand that this drink stall is an important pit stop for them.
For easier maintenance of timber platform from muddy footprints, and also
for different experiences, the platform spans across 3 bays, instead of
all 5 bays. A ramp is built for universal design. The storeroom is centralized
as a result of Ah Ma’s feedback on design proposals. People tend to have
more personal space in a kampong setting, than in an urban one, dividing
the sitting area gives patrons more sitting options.</p>
<p><strong>Kampung House Restoration Programme&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>To adopt a more concerted approach to existing efforts to conserve the
rich cultural heritage of Pulau Ubin, NParks will be implementing a dedicated <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/pulau-ubin/the-ubin-project/ura-design-guidelines-for-kampung-restorations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Kampung House Restoration Programme</a></strong>.
The programme will commence next year with the restoration of five vacant
non-residential kampung houses for community and commercial use.&nbsp;
<br>In an effort to retain the rustic look of the kampung NParks would be
guided by URA Design Guidelines for Kampung Restorations.</p>
