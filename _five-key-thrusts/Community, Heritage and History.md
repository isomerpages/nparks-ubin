<p>The Ubin Project encourages members of the community to actively organise
and lead initiatives that help to make a difference on the island. Key
community efforts include the annual open house festival Pesta Ubin, Balik
Kampong Party, and the restoration of kampong structures. One refurbished
traditional house is Teck Seng's Place, an authentic Chinese kampong house
that is open for the public to learn about Pulau Ubin's cultural heritage.
Many photographs and display items in it were contributed by the local
Ubin community.</p>
<h4>Ubin Day</h4>
<p>First started in 2002, <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/activities/events-and-workshops/2020/9/pesta-ubin-and-ubin-day-2020" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ubin Day</a></strong> is
a yearly community event held at Pulau Ubin to celebrate the different
facets of the island. During Ubin Day, various community groups set up
educational booths and organise a myriad of activities in collaboration
with NParks&nbsp; on the island.</p>
<h4>Pesta Ubin</h4>
<p>Pesta Ubin started as a festival organised by FUN members and the community
as an extended celebration of Ubin Day in 2016. It aims to highlight the
island’s culture, heritage and biodiversity through the various activities
held throughout the period. In collaboration with NParks, volunteers and
community groups organised activities such as kayaking, kampong, nature
tours, and art workshops during Pesta Ubin.</p>
<h4>Kawan Ubin</h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/KawanUbin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kawan Ubin</a></strong> is
a project spearheaded by the Singapore Heritage Society (SHS) that aims
to help conserve Ubin’s heritage.&nbsp;On 24 February 2018, NParks and
Kawan Ubin worked together to throw the first Balik Kampung party for the
residents, past and present and their families.&nbsp;The celebration aimed
to be the first in a series of community get-togethers and included games,
dinner, a documentary screening and even a “lohei” session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tudor House in Pulau Ubin</p>
<p>This one-of-a-kind house may well be the only authentic Tudor-style building
with a fireplace in Singapore. Fondly known as<strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/pulau-ubin/heritage/places-of-interest/house-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> House No. 1 </a></strong>(its
postal address on Pulau Ubin), the cottage was built in the 1930s by the
then Chief Surveyor, Langdon Williams, as a holiday retreat. Its unique
architecture style is similar to that of tea plantation residences during
the British colonial era.
<br>
<br>The building was designated a Conservation Building by the Urban Redevelopment
Authority (URA) in December 2003, and works began to restore it after decades
of exposure to the harsh coastal conditions. Much effort went into retaining
the building’s original design – replacement materials were carefully sourced
while layers of dirt and grime were painstakingly removed from the stone
and brickwork to expose the original finish.
<br>
<br>In 2007, as part of the newly launched Chek Jawa Wetlands, House No. 1
was opened to the public as the Chek Jawa Visitor Centre. In the same year,
it received an Architectural Heritage Award from URA.</p>

<h4>Pulau Ubin Cultural Mapping Project</h4>
<p>The&nbsp;National Heritage Board (NHB) commissioned a <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/NationalHeritageBoardSG/posts/pulau-ubin-cultural-mapping-projectrustic-nature-in-danger-these-are-popular-wor/1085230098166525/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cultural Mapping Project</a></strong> to
study the island’s community and social networks in April 2015. The year-long
project documented the well-loved island’s living heritage through oral
history accounts and lifestyles of its current and former residents.&nbsp;
<br>The findings revealed that Pulau Ubin’s kampong-centred social network
is a thriving one, and even extends beyond residents of the island to non-residents
and regular visitors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The kampong lifestyle endures on Pulau Ubin with unique cultural events
like the week-long Tua Pek Kong festival, which continues to strengthen
local bonds of friendship. The festival, which features spirit medium processions,
rituals, opera, <em>getai</em> (live stage) performances and lion dances,
also attracts thousands of visitors to the island. This offers a platform
to renew and expand the social network that spans from the island to the
mainland.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Visitors to Pulau Ubin are drawn into the network through diverse connections
with the island, whether through work, family-run businesses, informal
apprenticeships, religious activities, or fitness and leisure. The constant
flow of non-residents to the island and their induction into the existing
network reflect an evolving kampong community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the project,&nbsp;NHB has produced a 25-minute documentary
titled <em>Life on Ubin</em>, which presents the memories and experiences
of current and former residents of the island. Click <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-piaeo_RsBs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a></strong> to

<p>“I have lived on Ubin for around twenty years. I have spent most of my
life in the hills or out at sea. I have been running around on beaches
since I was five. I learnt the hook technique from observing others. Some
people may know how to use the hook to extract crabs but very few know
how to do so without injuring the crabs … I can sell 200-gram crabs, but
I can’t bring myself to do so. They should not be caught when they are
not fully grown.”</p>
