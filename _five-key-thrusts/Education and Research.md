<p><strong>Nurturing the Next Generation</strong>
</p>
<p>Pulau Ubin is an ideal place to train the next generation to become our
cultural and natural heritage stewards. A programme is in place to proactively
engage schools and tertiary institutions on various projects.</p>
<p>Students from Ngee Ann Polytechnic planted up the <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/pulau-ubin/biodiversity/places-of-interest/ubin-fruit-orchard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ubin Fruit Orchard</a></strong>,
an arboretum of local fruit trees, and contributed to freshwater wetlands
restoration at the Sensory Trail Pond, from landscape design to planting.
Republic Polytechnic students designed three out of six models of bat boxes
which serve as artificial roosts for bats. ITE College East took part in
species recovery projects, where students fabricated bat boxes and bee-
eater nest boxes, as well as planting of trees for nesting by the Baya
Weaver.</p>
<p>Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) also partners the National Parks Board in
the care of Pulau Ubin. Project Island-a-Hand sees OBS student participants
and alumni involved in reforestation projects to restore habitats for wildlife,
as well as clean-up of the island’s shores.</p>
<p>Schools have also come aboard as partners for other programmes, including
the design and fabrication of informative signs, painting of rubbish bins,
wildlife monitoring, reforestation and nature camps.</p>

<h4>Ubin Living Lab</h4>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/pulau-ubin/biodiversity/places-of-interest/ubin-living-lab" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ubin Living Lab (ULL)</a></strong> serves
as an integrated facility for field studies, education and research, and
community outreach. It is an outdoor learning classroom where activities
are held to encourage visitors to learn about the biodiversity, heritage
and culture of Pulau Ubin.
<br>
<br>Sited at a former resort, the ULL was first announced in November 2014
as one of the initiatives under The Ubin Project. During the planning stage,
different stakeholders gave suggestions on the development of ULL and its
facilities, and their inputs were incorporated into the design.
<br>
<br>Phase 1 of the project saw the refurbishment of two buildings from the
former resort to house two laboratories, a multi-purpose hall, meeting
and seminar rooms as well as two dormitories and a basic first-aid post.
There is also a campsite that can accommodate up to 100 campers, and a
mangrove arboretum that will eventually showcase all 35 mangrove species
that can be found in Singapore.</p>
<p>Phase 2 saw the completion of the water treatment system as well as the
new coastal arboretum that showcases about 500 trees representing around
70 native species that occur in the coastal environment in Singapore.
<br>
<br>Future phases of the ULL will include the test-bedding of technologies
in sustainable design and practices in waste management, electrical power
supply, and green buildings.

<h4>Field Studies</h4>
<p><strong>Singapore Hornbill Project<br></strong>Initiated in 2004 by French
researcher Marc Cremades, and avid naturalist Professor Ng Soon Chye, the
Singapore Hornbill Project studied the nesting ecology of the Oriental
Pied Hornbill (<strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/1/7/174" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anthracoceros albirostris</a></em></strong>),
such as the growth progression of nestlings, food requirements, and sensitivity
to external disturbances. This was the first project in the world to document
the breeding ecology of wild hornbills within the nest. The key objective
was to enhance the population and distribution of this locally endangered
bird in Singapore.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The bird’s breeding behaviour was monitored to better understand the factors
behind nesting success and failure. Infrared video cameras were installed
in both natural and artificial nests to capture what happens after a female
seals herself in to raise her brood of chicks. Cameras outside the nests
also recorded the activities of the males as they bring food to the nests.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Modern technology was also utilised to study the species. A Global Positioning
System (GPS) transmitter was attached to a hornbill to obtain information
on its movement, distribution and breeding territory.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Survey of Medium-sized Mammals</strong> 
<br>From September 2008 to March 2009, National University of Singapore undergraduate
Marcus Chua conducted a survey to get an updated status of medium-sized
mammals on Pulau Ubin. Line transects and camera trapping were deployed
in forested areas in the eastern and western parts of the island.
<br>
<br>The study produced distribution maps for four species of medium-sized
mammals – the Common Palm Civet (<strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/4/7/477" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paradoxurus hermaphroditus</a></em></strong>),
Greater Mousedeer (<strong><em><a href="http://https//www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/1/1/11" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tragulus napu</a></em></strong>),
Long-tailed Macaque (<strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/4/7/475" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Macaca fascicularis</a></em></strong>)
and Wild Pig (<strong><em><a href="http://https//www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/fauna/5/4/542" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sus scrofa</a></em></strong>).
The Long-tailed Macaque was recorded only in the east, while the other
three species were found in forests in both the east and west.
<br>
<br>The survey also resulted in the rediscovery of the Greater Mousedeer,
which was last recorded from Singapore in 1923. It was found to be well
distributed in the study sites and have an existing breeding population.
<br>
</p>
<p>Survey results also suggested the recreational use of the island which
mainly takes place during the day does not interfere with the activity
of the three largely nocturnal species, the Common Palm Civet, Greater
Mousedeer and Wild Pig.</p>

<p><strong>Seagrass Monitoring </strong>
<br>Started in 2007 by Dr Siti Maryam Yaakub, TeamSeaGrass is a collaboration
between the National Parks Board and Seagrass-Watch. The group carries
out regular monitoring of seagrasses on Singapore’s shores.
<br>
<br>Seagrasses are the only flowering plants adapted to living entirely immersed
in seawater. They provide homes for many marine organisms and their underground
stems and roots form a mat which stabilises the sediments. Seagrasses are
also an important food source for marine animals such as turtles and dugongs.
<br>
<br>Out of the 12 species of seagrasses found in Singapore, at least seven
can be found at <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/pulau-ubin/biodiversity/places-of-interest/chek-jawa-wetlands" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chek Jawa Wetlands</a></strong>.
The southern end of the seagrass lagoon at the wetlands is dominated by
Ribbon Seagrass (<em>Cymodocea rotundata</em>) while the rest of the seagrass
meadow there comprises a mix of species, including Spoon Seagrass (<em>Halophila ovalis</em>)
and Needle Seagrass (<em>Halodule uninervis</em>).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Survey of Mangrove Insects </strong>
<br>In 2012, Dr Patrick Grootaert of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural
Sciences embarked on a two-year survey of insects at four mangrove sites
in Singapore, in collaboration with the National University of Singapore
and National Parks Board. The number and diversity of insects serve as
an indicator of the mangrove habitat quality.
<br>
<br>The survey revealed that the mangroves at Chek Jawa Wetlands, Pulau Semakau
(two sites) and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve host a diverse assemblage
of insects, many of which are confined to the mangrove habitat. Chek Jawa
Wetlands alone is home to 77 species of long-legged flies, 36 fast-running
flies, 14 termites, and 53 bees and wasps. There is a high percentage of
long-legged flies and fast-running flies that are found in only one of
the sites, and this highlights the importance of conserving multiple areas
of mangrove habitats.</p>

<h4>Biodiversity Surveys</h4>
<p>To properly manage Pulau Ubin’s natural heritage, biodiversity surveys
have been conducted to establish baseline inventories of plants and animals
and provide insights about how a species is doing over time. The findings
help in developing suitable strategies for conserving habitats and species,
and maintaining a healthy ecosystem.
<br>
<br>Baseline surveys of plants, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, butterflies,
fireflies and marine biodiversity have been carried out with the help of
volunteers. A comprehensive survey will commence in late 2017 to update
these inventories and establish new ones for other groups of wildlife like
dragonflies and damselflies,&nbsp; bees and wasps, ants, moths and spiders.</p>
<p>
<br><strong>BioBlitz </strong>
<br>The first BioBlitz@Ubin was conducted in December 2016 to provide an updated
snapshot of Pulau Ubin’s biodiversity. It was also the first 24-hour biodiversity
survey in Singapore. About 100 citizen scientists worked alongside experts
and to survey a total of 15 different biodiversity groups, recording over
450 species.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wildlife Monitoring </strong>
<br>Transect and point count surveys are also regularly conducted for wildlife
like birds and butterflies, as rapid indicators of the health of biodiversity
and their habitats. During these surveys, volunteers conduct visual observations,
listen for bird calls and record the number of species they encounter while
walking specific routes. Schools are also roped in to help monitor the
progress of habitat enhancement and species recovery projects on the island.
<br>
<br>To supplement bird surveys, <strong><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/nparksbuzz/issue-02-vol-2-2009/conservation/about-birds-and-their-bands" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bird ringing</a></strong> sessions
are also conducted. During these sessions, mist nets are put up to catch
birds, and basic measurements and observations are recorded. A small ring
with a unique number is then fitted around each bird’s leg before release.
This allows researchers to identify and track the bird’s movement if it
is recaptured in future surveys. Data collected from bird ringing surveys
provide useful information on migratory patterns, life history, population,
distribution and habitat use of different bird species.</p>
