<h4>Interesting Places to Visit!</h4>
<p><strong>Sensory Trail</strong>
</p>
<p>This trail was developed to showcase the cultural heritage of Pulau Ubin
and engage the five senses through the plants that the villagers grew.
It offers a glimpse into the early days of Singapore, when such plants
were widely used in village life. The 1.5 km trail also leads you through
mangroves and ends at the freshwater Sensory Trail Pond which offers scenic
views and wonderful photo opportunities.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Teck&nbsp;Seng’s&nbsp;Place</strong>
</p>
<p>On the hill above the Sensory Trail Pond sits Teck&nbsp;Seng’s&nbsp;Place,
which was owned by Chew Teck Seng, a local provision shop owner. When you
visit this kampong house, be immersed in the story of the Chew family who
lived on Pulau Ubin in the 1970s. The family resettled to the main island
of Singapore when poultry farming on Pulau Ubin was phased out.</p>
<p>In 2008, the house was refurbished by the National Parks Board to serve
as a demonstration Chinese kampong house on the Pulau Ubin. The original
architecture was retained and changes were kept to a minimum to conserve
its rustic charm. Many of the items in the house, including furniture,
electrical appliances, kitchen utensils, and photographs, were donated
by past and present residents, as well as friends of Pulau Ubin.</p>
<p>Teck&nbsp;Seng’s&nbsp;Place is open for public visits on the second and
fourth weekends each month, as well as during public holidays. Participants
of the Kampong Tour and Rustic Reflections Tour will also get to visit
the house.</p>

<p><strong>Chek Jawa Wetlands</strong>
</p>
<p>Located at the eastern end of Pulau Ubin, Chek Jawa Wetlands is 3 km from
the public jetty. To get there, you can hire a van or rent a bicycle from
the main village. For the more adventurous, a walk from the jetty would
take about 40 minutes. Covering an area of about 100 ha, Chek Jawa Wetlands
is unique in that several ecosystems can be seen in one area&nbsp;–&nbsp;sandy
beach, rocky beach, seagrass lagoon, coral rubble, mangroves and coastal
forest. Visit the Tudor-style House No. 1, which has been adapted for use
as the Chek Jawa Visitor Centre. Take a stroll along 1.1 km of boardwalks
to look out for wildlife, and climb the 21 m Jejawi Tower to take in the
scenery.</p>

<p><strong>Butterfly Hill</strong>
</p>
<p>Get up close with winged beauties! The Butterfly Hill was specially created
to conserve and showcase butterflies. Located within Jelutong Campsite,
it was developed in 2005 on a piece of quarry wasteland reclaimed from
the sea during past granite quarrying operations. About a football field
in size, the knoll attracts approximately 140 species of butterflies&nbsp;–&nbsp;you
need to spend only half an hour on a sunny day to encounter more than 20
species fluttering around. More than 50 butterfly-attracting plant species
have been included in the landscape. Today, Butterfly Hill serves as a
successful model to both conserve and increase public appreciation of butterflies.</p>

<p><strong>Puaka Hill</strong>

<p>At 74 m, Puaka Hill is the highest point on Pulau Ubin. Hike up the hill
and tackle the winding path which pass through Tembusu (<strong><em><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/florafaunaweb/flora/2/8/2895" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cyrtophyllum fragrans</a></em></strong>)
